# Day 4 Task – Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning

## Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build multiple machine learning models on a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
**Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster**  
Source: Kaggle  
File used: `train.csv`

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values (Age, Embarked)
- Dropping irrelevant features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Correlation heatmap
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Machine learning model development

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 81.00% |
| Decision Tree | 78.21% |
| Random Forest | 82.12% |

## Best Model
**Random Forest Classifier**

## Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance Analysis

## Key Insights
- Gender and passenger class significantly influence survival.
- Fare and age also contribute to survival prediction.
- Ensemble models perform better than individual models.

## Output
Screenshots of EDA plots and confusion matrix are included in the `screenshots` folder.
