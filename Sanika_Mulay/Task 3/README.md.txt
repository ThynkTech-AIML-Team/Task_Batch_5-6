Task 1: Basic Text Classification

## Objective
Build a simple text classification model and compare multiple algorithms.

## Dataset Used
20 Newsgroups Dataset (Binary Classification)

## Models Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Result
Compared performance of three models and analyzed their accuracy and prediction behavior.

Task 2: Word Embedding Mini Task

## Model Used
GloVe (glove-wiki-gigaword-50)

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded pretrained embedding model
- Found similar words (example: king → queen)
- Performed word analogy (king - man + woman)
- Visualized 10 words using PCA (2D plot)

## Result
Successfully demonstrated semantic similarity and word relationships using pretrained embeddings.
