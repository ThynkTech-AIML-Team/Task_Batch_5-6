# Image Processing Mini Tasks

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform basic image processing operations using OpenCV.

---

## Operations Performed

### 1. Image Loading

Loaded an image using OpenCV and displayed it using Matplotlib.

---

### 2. Grayscale Conversion

Converted RGB image into grayscale format.

Purpose:
Simplifies image processing operations.

---

### 3. Edge Detection (Canny)

Used Canny Edge Detection to detect image edges.

Benefits:
- Detects object boundaries
- Useful in computer vision applications

---

### 4. Image Thresholding

Applied binary thresholding to convert image into black and white.

Purpose:
- Segmentation
- Improves clarity

---

### 5. Image Augmentation

Performed augmentation operations:

#### Flip
- Horizontal flipping

#### Rotation
- Rotated image by 45 degrees

#### Brightness Adjustment
- Increased brightness
