# Image Classifier Web Application

## Objective

The objective of this project is to deploy an image classification model as a web application using Streamlit.

Users can upload an image and receive a predicted class label.

---

## Model Used

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on MNIST dataset.

Accuracy: ~98–99%

---

## Application Features

- Upload image
- Automatic preprocessing
- Model prediction
- Display predicted class

---


---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Pillow

---

## How to Run the Application

Step 1: Open terminal

Step 2: cd Deployment/app

Step 3: streamlit run app.py


Step 4:

Open browser at: http://localhost:8501


---

## How it Works

1. User uploads image
2. Image is converted to grayscale
3. Image is resized to 28×28
4. Image is normalized
5. Model predicts class
6. Prediction is displayed
