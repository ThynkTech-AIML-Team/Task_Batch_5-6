# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.

## Project Work
- Performed data cleaning and handled missing values
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied feature engineering
- Trained and compared multiple models
- Selected Random Forest as the final model
- Built a Streamlit web app for prediction

## Model Used
Random Forest Classifier  
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

## How to Run

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app:
cd 2_Deployment
python -m streamlit run app.py

## Output
The app allows users to input passenger details and predicts survival.
