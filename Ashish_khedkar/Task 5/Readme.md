## Part 1 – MNIST Image Classification

**Algorithms Used:**

* Logistic Regression
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Result:**

* CNN achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression on MNIST
* CNN handled digit classification more effectively

---

## Part 2 – Image Processing using OpenCV

**Algorithms / Techniques Used:**

* Grayscale conversion
* Canny Edge Detection
* Image Thresholding
* Image Augmentation (flip, rotation, brightness adjustment)

**Result:**

* Successfully extracted edges from images
* Binary thresholded image obtained
* Generated augmented versions of the original image for analysis

---

## Part 3 – Mini Deployment (Digit Recognition App)

**Algorithm Used:**

* Strong CNN trained on MNIST
* Streamlit for deployment

**Result:**

* Model correctly predicted digits from MNIST-style images
* Web application demonstrated real-time digit recognition
