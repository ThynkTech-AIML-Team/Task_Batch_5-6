Project Overview
- Short: Train and compare classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on a CSV dataset.

Dataset Used
- iris.csv 

Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (with feature importance)
- Random Forest (with feature importance)

Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

| Logistic Regression | Accuracy | See notebook | See notebook |
| Decision Tree | Accuracy | See notebook | See notebook |
| Random Forest | Accuracy | See notebook | See notebook |

Notes
- Open `ML_model_development.ipynb` and run all cells to reproduce results and populate the comparison table values.
