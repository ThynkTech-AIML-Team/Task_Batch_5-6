# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand survival patterns and important features.

## Dataset

* Titanic dataset (Seaborn)
* Total records: 891
* Target variable: survived

## Data Cleaning

* Filled missing values in Age using median
* Filled missing values in Embarked using mode
* Removed Deck column due to many missing values

## Feature Engineering

* Created family_size feature
* Created is_alone feature
* Created age_group categories

## Visualizations

* Age distribution histogram
* Fare boxplot
* Survival count plot
* Survival by gender and class
* Correlation heatmap

## Key Insights

* Females had higher survival rate than males
* First class passengers survived more
* Higher fare passengers survived more
* Passenger class and sex strongly affect survival

## Tools Used

Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
