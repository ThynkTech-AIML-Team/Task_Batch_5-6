# NLP Research & Applications Hub

Welcome to the **NLP Research & Applications Hub**! This project is a curated collection of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, ranging from unsupervised topic discovery to multi-lingual sentiment analysis.

## 🚀 Overview
This repository contains three specialized Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a core pillar of modern NLP. Whether you're interested in how machines group large volumes of text, how words are numerically represented in vector spaces, or how to detect emotions across different languages, this project provides a hands-on exploration.

## 🛠️ Project Modules

### 1. Topic Modeling Research Dashboard
*   **Objective:** Extract hidden thematic structures from the **20 Newsgroups** dataset.
*   **Techniques:** Compares **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**.
*   **Visualization:** Features an interactive **pyLDAvis** dashboard for intuitive topic exploration.
*   **Evaluation:** Uses Coherence and Perplexity scores to find the most meaningful topic clusters.

### 2. Word Embedding Explorer
*   **Objective:** Deep dive into how word vectors capture semantic relationships.
*   **Models:** Comparison of **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Analogy Solver:** Solves classic analogies like *King - Man + Woman = Queen*.
    *   **Similarity Search:** Finds the most semantically related words.
    *   **2D Visualization:** Uses **t-SNE** and **PCA** to map high-dimensional embeddings into a visual 2D space.
    *   **OOV Handling:** Demonstrates how FastText handles rare or misspelled words using subword information.

### 3. Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis
*   **Objective:** Compare sentiment detection across **English** and **Hindi**.
*   **Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art Hugging Face Transformers:
    *   `distilbert-base-uncased` for English.
    *   `txlm-roberta-hindi-sentiment` for Hindi.
*   **Outcome:** Analyzes the nuances of sentiment in different scripts and the impact of training data on model accuracy.
