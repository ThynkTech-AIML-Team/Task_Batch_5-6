# Image Classification using MNIST

## Overview
This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using Logistic Regression and CNN. The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28×28.

## Models Used

| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~92% |
| CNN | ~98–99% |

CNN performs better because it extracts spatial features from images.

## Preprocessing
• Normalization (0–255 → 0–1)  
• Reshaping for CNN  
• Flattening for Logistic Regression  

## Evaluation
• Accuracy Score  
• Confusion Matrix  
• Training vs Validation Accuracy Graph
