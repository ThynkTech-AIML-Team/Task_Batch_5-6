# Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Model Development

## Objective

Build and compare multiple machine learning models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

## Dataset

* Titanic dataset (Seaborn)
* Target variable: survived

## Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values
* Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding
* Split dataset into training and testing sets

## Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report
* Feature Importance (Random Forest)

## Results Summary

* Logistic Regression provides good baseline performance
* Decision Tree captures non-linear patterns
* Random Forest provides highest accuracy and best performance

## Bonus – Hyperparameter Tuning

* Applied GridSearchCV on Random Forest
* Improved model performance after tuning

## Tools Used

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
