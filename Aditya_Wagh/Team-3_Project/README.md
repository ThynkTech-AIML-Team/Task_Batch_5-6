# 🧠 AI Fake News Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI Fake News Detection System is a Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies news articles as Fake News or Real News.

The system performs text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and trains multiple machine learning models to achieve high classification accuracy.

A Streamlit web application is deployed for real-time prediction.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a text classification model that detects whether a news article is fake or real using Machine Learning and NLP techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset used: Fake and Real News Dataset (ISOT)

Source:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Dataset contains:

- Fake.csv → Fake news articles  
- True.csv → Real news articles  

Total dataset size: ~44,000 news articles.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Streamlit  
- Matplotlib

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

- Combined Fake and Real datasets  
- Added labels (Fake = 0, Real = 1)  
- Converted text to lowercase  
- Removed punctuation and special characters  
- Removed stopwords  
- Merged title and text into a single content column  

This prepares the dataset for feature extraction and model training.

## 🔍 Feature Engineering

Used:

- TF-IDF Vectorizer  
- N-gram features  

TF-IDF converts textual data into numerical form so machine learning models can process it.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Multiple models were trained and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Passive Aggressive Classifier  
- Ensemble Model (Best Performing Model)

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~98% |
| SVM | ~99% |
| Passive Aggressive | ~99% |
| Ensemble Model | 99.41% |

The ensemble model achieved the highest validation accuracy.
