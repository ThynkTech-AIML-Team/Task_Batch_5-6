# Task 3 – NLP Internship Assignment

## Overview
This task demonstrates multiple Natural Language Processing techniques including text classification, word embeddings, and a simple FAQ chatbot.

---

## Part 1 – Text Classification
Built a spam detection system using the SMS Spam Dataset.

### Models Used:
- CountVectorizer
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

### Results:
The models achieved high accuracy in detecting spam vs ham messages.
Confusion matrix and classification reports are included in the notebook.

## Part 2 – Word Embeddings
Used pretrained word embeddings to:
- Find similar words
- Perform analogy tasks
- Understand semantic similarity between words.

---

## Part 3 – FAQ Chatbot
Implemented a simple NLP chatbot using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity

The chatbot responds to predefined questions using similarity matching.
