1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   -> Perform detailed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, relationships, and feature importance.
   Results:
   -> Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.
   -> First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
   -> Gender was the strongest predictor of survival.

2: Machine Learning Model Development:
   -> Dataset used: house price prediction dataset
   -> Build and compare regression models to predict house prices
   -> model implemented: Linear Regression, Decision tree, random forest
   -> Evaluation metrics: MSE, r2 score

3: Mini Deployment Project:
    -> House price prediction webapp
    -> streamlit used to create ui
    -> use house_price.pkl model file for prediction
    -> successfully deployed on streamlit cloud
