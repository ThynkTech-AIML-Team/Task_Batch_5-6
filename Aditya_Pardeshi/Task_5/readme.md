## 1. Image Classification Project 
• Objective: 
Build an image classification model using traditional ML and deep learning 
techniques. 
• Dataset Options: 
MNIST Digit Dataset 
CIFAR-10 Dataset 
Custom Image Dataset (Minimum 3 Classes) 
• Tasks: 
Perform image preprocessing (resize, normalization) 
Split dataset into train and test sets 
Train at least 2 models (e.g., CNN and Logistic Regression) 
Compare model performance 
• Evaluation Metrics: 
Accuracy 
Confusion Matrix 
Training vs Validation Accuracy Graph 
## 2. Image Processing Mini Tasks 
• Perform the following using OpenCV: 
Edge Detection (Canny) 
Image Thresholding 
Image Augmentation (flip, rotate, brightness adjustment) 
## 3. Mini Deployment Project (Choose One) 
• Option A: Digit Recognition Web App 
Deploy trained MNIST model using Streamlit 
• Option B: Image Classifier Web Tool 
Upload image and predict class label 
• Option C: Real-time Camera Prediction 
Use webcam to classify objects in real time
