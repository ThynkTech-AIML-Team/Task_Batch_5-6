### 1. Topic Modeling Research Dashboard 
• Take a dataset (20 Newsgroups or research articles). 
• Train both LDA and NMF models. 
• Visualize topics using pyLDAvis in a dashboard. 
• Compare models with coherence & perplexity scores. 
• Bonus: Try BERTopic (transformer-based topic modeling). 
### 2. Word Embedding Explorer 
• Load pretrained GloVe embeddings. 
• Perform word similarity & analogy tasks (king - man + woman ≈ queen). 
• Perform t-SNE / PCA visualization of embeddings in 2D clusters. 
• Compare Word2Vec vs FastText vs GloVe. 
• Show how FastText handles out-of-vocabulary words better. 
### 3. End-to-End NLP Application (Choose One) 
• News Similarity Search → Input one article, output top 3 most similar ones. 
• Resume Parser with NER → Extract skills, education, organizations, names. 
• Embedding Explorer → Build an interactive tool to explore word clusters & analogies. 
• Multi-lingual Sentiment Analysis → Compare sentiment analysis in English vs Hindi 
using Hugging Face models.
