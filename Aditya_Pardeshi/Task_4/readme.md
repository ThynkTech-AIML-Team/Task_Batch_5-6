## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project 
• Objective: 
Perform detailed exploratory data analysis on a real-world dataset. 
• Dataset Options: 
Titanic Dataset 
House Price Prediction Dataset 
Loan Prediction Dataset 
• Tasks: 
Handle missing values 
Perform feature engineering 
Create visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap) 
Write key insights from data 
## 2. Machine Learning Model Development 
• Objective: 
Build and compare multiple machine learning models. 
• Models to Compare: 
Linear Regression / Logistic Regression 
Decision Tree 
Random Forest 
• Evaluation Metrics: 
Accuracy (for classification) 
Mean Squared Error (for regression) 
Confusion Matrix 
Feature Importance Analysis 
• Bonus: 
Apply Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV 
Compare model performance before and after tuning
