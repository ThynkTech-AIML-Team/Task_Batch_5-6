**Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Steps Performed:-

Data loading & inspection

Handling missing values

Feature engineering

Encoding categorical variables

Data visualization:-

Histograms

Boxplots

Correlation heatmap

Survival comparison charts

Key Insights:-

Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.

1st class passengers survived more than 3rd class.

Younger passengers had better survival chances.

Fare amount positively correlated with survival.


**Task 2 – Machine Learning Model Development**
 
Models Used:-

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Steps Performed:-

Train-test split

Model training

Accuracy comparison

Confusion matrix evaluation


**Task 3 - House Price Prediction Web Application**

Project Overview:-

This is a Mini Deployment Project where a Machine Learning regression model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

The model predicts house prices based on housing features such as income, house age, number of rooms, population, and location-related attributes.

Dataset Used:-
California Housing Dataset
This dataset is available in Scikit-learn and contains housing data from California districts.

Dataset Information:-

The California Housing Dataset includes the following features:
MedInc → Median Income
HouseAge → Median House Age
AveRooms → Average Rooms
AveBedrms → Average Bedrooms
Population → Population in block
AveOccup → Average Occupancy
Latitude → Latitude location
Longitude → Longitude location
